# Rainier Card Definition Fetcher
![logo](logo.png)

This is a small helper program used for both Omukade development and fetching card and rule data used to run the Omukade family of TCGL servers.
**You need this to run an Omukade server.**

## Requirements
* [.NET 6 Runtime or SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) for your platform
* A set of current TCGL assemblies and updated by PAR
* Supports Windows x64 and Linux x64 + ARM64
* For developing, Visual Studio 2022 (any edition) with C#, and [Procedual Assembly Rewriter](https://github.com/Hastwell/Omukade.ProcedualAssemblyRewriter)

## Usage

Before running this command, populate the file `secrets.json` in the app's directory with your Pokemon Trainer's Club account. This account is used to fetch
data from the TCGL servers. eg:
```json
{"username": "mysigninname", "password": "abc123"}
```

**The account used must have previously logged into TCGL** as this app cannot deal with any of the first-signin "authorize TCGL to access your account" stuff.

This application uses AutoPAR to load the TCGL assemblies. Before using this application, you must do one of the following:
* Windows Only, Recommended: Install Pokemon TCG Live. It will be auto-detected by AutoPAR and used for this application.
* Add the setting `autopar-search-folder` with the location of your TCGL install directory to secrets.json. Backslashes and quotes must be escaped (`\\` and `\"` respectively).
* Copy the TCGL assemblies from your TCGL install directory (`C:\Install\Folder\Pokémon Trading Card Game Live\Pokemon TCG Live_Data\Managed`) to the folder `autopar` under the app's folder.
  Alternatively, the config setting `autopar-search-folder` can be used to set any other name for this directory if prefered. *You must manually update this folder whenever the game updates!*

### Arguments
```
Fetch arguments (as many as desired can be specified):
--fetch-itemdb          Fetches the database of items.
--fetch-cardactions     Fetches the localized list of card actions.
--fetch-carddb          Fetches the list of cards for display in-game (not implementations, see --fetch-carddefinitions)
--fetch-carddefinitions / --fetch-carddefs Fetches all card implementations.
--ignore-invalid-ids-file   By default, --fetch-carddefinitions will create a file of known-bad card IDs that can be skipped
                            for significantly faster performance on subsequent executions (minutes vs hours).
                            These entries may become stale as skipped cards become implemented; --fetch-carddefinitions should
                            probably be run monthly with this flag.

                            If the invalid IDs file doesn't already exist, this flag will have no effect.

--fetch-rules           Fetches the game rules.
--fetch-aidecks         Fetches a selection of decks used by the AI.

Omukade Cheyenne servers typically only need the results of --fetch-carddefinitions --fetch-rules

Output arguments:
--output-folder (/foo/bar)  Writes all fetched data to this folder. By default, the current working directory is used for output.
                            Directories will be created under this folder with all retrieved information.

Other arguments:
-h / --help             This help text. Will also appear automatically if run with no fetch arguments, or no arguments at all.
```

## Compiling

### Rainier Dependencies with AutoPAR
Before building this project, you'll need to run ManualPAR (part of the [Procedual Assembly Rewriter](https://github.com/Hastwell/Omukade.ProcedualAssemblyRewriter)) against the TCGL assemblies to produce a version
with public members that can be accessed by this tool.

These assemblies need to be located in:
```
[your sources folder]
|- Rainier-Assemblies
|  |- 1.3.11.156349.20221208_0543_PAR (or whatever version is latest)
|
|- Rainier.CardDefinitionFetcher
|  |- Rainier.CardDefinitionFetcher.sln
```

### Building
* Use Visual Studio 2022 or later, build the project.
* With the .NET 6 SDK, `dotnet build Rainier.CardDefinitionFetcher.sln`
